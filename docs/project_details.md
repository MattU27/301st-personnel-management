## Short Description of the Web App
The Personnel Dashboard is a military unit management system designed for the 301st Unit (Banto, Almero, INF-222). It provides an overview of unit personnel and status, displaying key metrics such as total personnel count (248), active missions (6), training status (92% unit readiness level), and equipment status (95% operational readiness). The dashboard allows commanders to monitor unit deployment status across teams (Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie) and track recent personnel activities including completed training, team assignments, and scheduled promotion reviews. This web application streamlines military personnel management and enhances operational awareness for unit leadership.
