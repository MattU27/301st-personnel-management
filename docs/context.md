## Notes for GitHub Copilot
- Use this structure to generate a graphical diagram in tools like Draw.io, Lucidchart, or Visio.
- Ensure a vertical top-to-bottom layout with clear boxes, labeled connections (e.g., "Secure API," "Data Storage," "Analytics"), and appropriate icons as specified.
- Replace any non-standard icons (e.g., green leaf for MongoDB, Google Drive for Express.js) with standard icons (e.g., database icon for MongoDB, Node.js logo for Express.js).
- If Kafka is included, clarify its role (e.g., real-time messaging) and use a Kafka icon (e.g., Apache Kafka logo).
- Maintain hierarchical indentation and connectivity as shown in the ASCII visualization.
