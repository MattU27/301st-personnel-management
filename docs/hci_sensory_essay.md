# Sensing Through Design: Applying Human vs. Computer Senses to Our Centralized Reservist Management System

As National University Manila BSIT students focusing on Web and Mobile Applications, our capstone project, the "Centralize Reservist Management System for 301st Community Defense Center using Blockchain with Prescriptive Analytics," tackles a vital need for modernizing personnel management within the reserve force. The current system often involves manual, fragmented processes, leading to potential inaccuracies. Our solution introduces a secure, unified platform using blockchain for data integrity and prescriptive analytics for informed decision-making, accessible via a web portal for administrators and a mobile app for reservists. Understanding Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), especially how humans and computers sense and process information, is critical for this project. A technically sound system is useless if administrators struggle with complex data presentation or if reservists find the mobile app confusing. Applying HCI sensory principles ensures our system translates its advanced features into a truly usable and efficient experience, bridging the gap between complex technology and user needs.

Designing the interfaces demanded careful consideration of human senses, primarily vision and touch. For the administrative web portal displaying personnel records and analytics, visual clarity is key. We're using clear information hierarchy through headings and layout, utilizing visual cues like charts and graphs for analytics instead of just raw data, and ensuring accessibility through sufficient color contrast and consistent design to minimize cognitive load. For the reservist mobile app, visual design focuses on readability with legible fonts and high contrast, simplified navigation using standard mobile patterns, and clear visual feedback for actions, loading states, and important alerts like training deadlines. Touch interaction on the mobile app relies on standard gestures (taps, scrolls) with adequately sized touch targets to prevent errors, adhering to platform guidelines. We're also considering selective haptic feedback for critical confirmations. Even for the web portal's keyboard and mouse interaction, ensuring logical tab order and clear hover states improves usability. The main challenge is balancing information density for admins with simplicity for reservists across diverse devices and potential accessibility needs.

Our system also incorporates "computer sensing"—interpreting digital inputs. A core example is using the mobile camera for Service ID verification. The system "senses" the ID via image processing, performs OCR to extract text, and potentially uses facial recognition. It then compares this sensed data against database records, responding with verification confirmation or specific error feedback. Accuracy and reasonable responsiveness are vital here. We must anticipate sensor limitations like poor lighting or blurry images, providing guidance to the user (e.g., "Ensure good lighting") rather than just failing the scan. Other computer sensing includes interpreting standard touchscreen gestures on the mobile app and keyboard/mouse inputs on the web portal. Furthermore, the prescriptive analytics engine "senses" patterns in the personnel data stored on the blockchain, processing this information based on predefined rules to generate recommendations (like promotion eligibility) or alerts (like training gaps). Its perception is purely logical and data-driven, limited by data quality and the comprehensiveness of the analytical models.

Analyzing a key interaction—a reservist checking promotion eligibility via the mobile app—highlights the HCI loop. The **Human Input** is the reservist tapping the "Check Eligibility" button. The **System Response** involves querying the backend, processing data against promotion criteria using the analytics engine, and displaying the result (eligible or specific missing requirements) with visual feedback like a loading indicator. The **Human Feedback** is the reservist perceiving this information, understanding their status, and potentially taking further action. To ensure this loop is effective, we prioritize clarity (unambiguous language, clear visual distinction), smoothness (minimizing lag, providing loading feedback), and intuition (obvious button labels, straightforward result presentation). Potential issues include lag from slow networks or complex queries, confusing output if requirements aren't clearly listed, or lack of feedback on system errors.

Reflecting on the question "Can a system understand if it cannot feel?" reinforces that our system operates on logic. It senses data, perceives patterns according to rules, and determines outcomes like eligibility. However, it lacks true understanding or empathy. It can identify a missing training requirement but cannot comprehend the human reasons behind it (personal issues, conflicts, etc.). The analytics provide data-driven guidance but are based on institutional metrics, not emotional context. Therefore, our design must promote empathy indirectly. Clear, factual, and actionable feedback respects the user (e.g., stating *which* course is missing, not just "Ineligible"). Designing for accessibility shows consideration. Allowing easy correction of flagged errors empowers users. While our system can't feel, its interface can be considerate and respectful, acknowledging the human element within the structured military context. We deliberately avoided attempting to sense user emotion, focusing instead on clear, factual communication.

In conclusion, applying HCI sensory principles has been integral to shaping our Reservist Management System. Balancing the visual and tactile needs of administrators and reservists, while understanding the capabilities and limitations of computer sensing like image processing, is key to translating our technical goals into a usable reality. This reflection has led to a concrete improvement plan: enhancing the Service ID scanning feedback. Instead of just success/fail, we'll add real-time visual guides to help position the card and provide specific error messages ("Image too blurry," "Low light detected") to guide the user. This directly addresses computer sensing limitations by improving human input and feedback, making a critical function more robust and user-friendly. It exemplifies synthesizing HCI theory into practical development, ensuring our system effectively serves the 301st Ready Reserve Infantry Battalion.

**Annotations based on Sensory Design Principles:**

1.  **High Contrast & Readability (Vision):** The clear distinction between the dark sidebar navigation (#1 left) and the light content area (#2 main panel), along with black text on a white/light gray background within the table and summary cards, ensures high contrast for easy visual scanning and readability, reducing eye strain during prolonged use.
2.  **Clear Information Hierarchy (Vision):** The use of a prominent title ("Personnel Management"), clear table headers (NAME, RANK, COMPANY, etc.), and sectioned summary cards ("Personnel Statistics," "Company Distribution") helps administrators quickly understand the structure of the information presented. The distinct visual separation between rows in the table aids in tracking individual personnel records.
3.  **Visual Cues for Status (Vision):** The colored status indicators ("Standby" in yellow, "Retired" in gray - #3 in table) provide immediate visual cues about personnel status, allowing administrators to quickly assess readiness at a glance without reading detailed text. This leverages pre-attentive visual processing.
4.  **Actionable Icons (Vision/Interaction):** The "View" (eye icon) and "Edit" (pencil icon) buttons (#4 right side of table) use universally understood symbols, making their function clear visually. Their consistent placement on the right of each row creates a predictable interaction pattern for mouse users (touch/kinaesthetics via mouse).
5.  **Search and Filtering (Interaction/Vision):** The prominent search bar (#5 top) and dropdown filters for Company and Status allow administrators to quickly narrow down the displayed data, reducing visual clutter and cognitive load when searching for specific personnel or groups. This facilitates efficient interaction based on visual filtering.
6.  **Summary Statistics (Vision):** The cards at the bottom (#6) provide a quick visual summary of key statistics (e.g., total Standby vs. Retired personnel, distribution across companies). This allows administrators to grasp the overall situation quickly without needing to manually count or analyze the entire table, leveraging visual processing for data aggregation.
7.  **Clear Navigation (Vision/Interaction):** The sidebar navigation (#1 left) uses icons alongside text labels, clearly indicating different system sections. The highlighted "Personnel" tab shows the current location, aiding orientation. Pagination controls (#7 bottom right of table) allow manageable viewing of large datasets.
