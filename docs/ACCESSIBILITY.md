# Accessibility Guidelines for AFP Personnel Management System

This document outlines the accessibility standards and best practices that should be followed when developing and maintaining the AFP Personnel Management System. By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that our application is usable by people with various disabilities and impairments.

## Introduction

Accessibility is not just a legal requirement, but a moral obligation to ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, can access and use our application effectively. This includes accommodating users with:

- Visual impairments (blindness, low vision, color blindness)
- Hearing impairments (deafness, hard of hearing)
- Motor impairments (limited dexterity, tremors, paralysis)
- Cognitive impairments (learning disabilities, memory issues, attention deficits)

## Standards We Follow

Our application aims to comply with:

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- **Section 508** of the Rehabilitation Act
- **ADA** (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements

## Common Accessibility Issues

Avoid these common accessibility issues:

1. **Low Color Contrast** - Text that is difficult to read against its background
2. **Missing Alternative Text** - Images without descriptive alternative text
3. **Keyboard Inaccessibility** - Features that cannot be accessed via keyboard
4. **Missing Form Labels** - Form fields without associated labels
5. **Non-Semantic HTML** - Poor HTML structure making navigation difficult for screen readers
6. **Missing Document Structure** - Pages without proper headings and landmarks
7. **Motion-Based Interactions** - Features requiring specific gestures or movements
8. **Time Limits** - Content that disappears or sessions that time out too quickly

## Implementation Guidelines

### Keyboard Navigation

- Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable with keyboard
- Maintain a logical tab order (typically left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Add skip links to bypass repetitive navigation

```jsx
// Example of skip link implementation
<a href="#main-content" className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only">
  Skip to main content
</a>
```

### Screen Readers

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- Provide proper headings structure (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)
- Include alt text for images: `<img alt="Description of image">`
- Use ARIA attributes when necessary (but prefer native HTML semantics)
- Announce dynamic content changes using live regions

```jsx
// Example of a live region for announcements
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true" className="sr-only">
  {announcementMessage}
</div>
```

### Visual Impairments

- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Support text resizing up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- Ensure the site is usable in high contrast mode
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content

```css
/* Example of accessible text styles */
.body-text {
  font-size: 1rem; /* Minimum 16px for body text */
  line-height: 1.5; /* Adequate line spacing */
  color: #333; /* Ensure good contrast with background */
}
```

### Cognitive Impairments

- Use clear, simple language
- Provide consistent navigation
- Break content into manageable chunks
- Use illustrations, icons, and visual aids to support text
- Allow users to control time-sensitive content
- Minimize distractions and cognitive load

```jsx
// Example of clear error messaging
<div role="alert" className="error-message">
  <h3>Form Error</h3>
  <p>Please correct the following issues:</p>
  <ul>
    {errors.map(error => (
      <li key={error.id}>{error.message}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Motor Impairments

- Ensure clickable targets are at least 44Ã—44 pixels
- Provide adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Implement forgiving interfaces (e.g., confirm before destructive actions)
- Support alternative input methods
- Avoid time-based interactions

```css
/* Example of accessible button sizing */
.button {
  min-height: 44px;
  min-width: 44px;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  margin: 4px; /* Provide spacing between buttons */
}
```

## Testing for Accessibility

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Use tools like Lighthouse, axe DevTools, or WAVE
   - Integrate accessibility linting in CI/CD pipeline

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Test keyboard navigation throughout the application
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Check color contrast with tools like Colour Contrast Analyser
   - Test at different zoom levels (up to 200%)

3. **User Testing**
   - Conduct usability testing with users who have disabilities
   - Gather feedback and iterate on improvements

## Application-Specific Components

Our application includes the following accessibility-enhanced components:

1. **SkipToContent** - Allows keyboard users to bypass navigation
2. **ScreenReaderAnnouncer** - Announces dynamic content changes to screen readers
3. **Accessible Button** - Ensures buttons work properly with assistive technologies
4. **Card** - Provides semantic structure with proper heading levels

Use these components to maintain consistency in accessibility implementation across the application.
