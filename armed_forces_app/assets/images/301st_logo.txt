Instructions for adding a logo:

1. Add a PNG or JPEG image named "301st_logo.png" or "301st_logo.jpg" to this directory
2. The image should be the official logo of the 301st Ready Reserve Infantry Battalion
3. For optimal display, use a square image of at least 300x300 pixels
4. Ensure the background is transparent (for PNG) or contrasts well with the app's primary color

Note: Since the actual logo can't be generated by AI, you will need to obtain the official emblem/logo 
from the battalion and place it in this directory.
